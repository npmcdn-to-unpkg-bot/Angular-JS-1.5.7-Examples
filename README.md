# Angular-JS-1.5.7-Examples

Author: Luis Javier Montiel Arenas

What's this?

Angular JS is  a tool that I personally appreciate so much. When I was learning to use it, in so many times, I forgot how to do the things. Frequently I reviewed the tutorials again and again. In this repository I show examples of how to do some basics in Angular, in case that I have to review the things again, and of course, if it helps to anyone else out there, what better!
